# Biweekly Report 1 : Linear Regression #
My first biweekly report was an attempt to review, and implement some simple linear reggresion models. The first two attempts are on a data set I found, and I attempted to implement the models on the features I thought were impactful, with some help from some online resources. The latter half of the report is focused on reviewing a model that was more frutiful than mine, that being O.Ashenfelters linear model for wine quality. 

wine_SDA.csv was the dataset I found on kraggle, and the other .csv was the orginal data from the Ashenfelters model.
